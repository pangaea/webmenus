		<h4>Acceptable Use and Conduct</h4>
		<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and your data related to the Service. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless chowMagic(c) and its suppliers from any and all loss, cost, liability, and expense arising from or related to your data, your use of the Service, or your violation of these terms.</p>
		<p>The Software and Service are made available to you, your company, and/or your customers only for personal or commercial use, which use must be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and must not infringe or violate third party rights.</p>

		<h4>Fees</h4>
		<p>User fees are evaluated on a per-month contract agreement with chowMagic(c). Users can opt to upgrade or downgrade their service agreement to any other contract agreement that chowMagic(c) is currently offering for sale at any time during the userâs contract term. At the end of the contract term, the contract will automatically renew indefinitely until explicitly cancelled by the user. Cancellation must be issued via the Service. Any cancellation issued must be done three (3) days prior to the end of the contract term to allow for adequate processing time.</p>
 
		<h4>Chargeback / Refund Policy</h4>
		<p>chowMagic(c) will not, under any circumstances, issue cash refunds for early contract cancellation. If you have a question about charges made to your account, please contact us immediately. If the charges were made in error, we will credit your account or credit card account for the appropriate amount. chowMagic(c) has a zero tolerance policy for chargebacks. Any customer who disputes a credit card payment that is found to be valid will be permanently banned from use of the Beanstalk service.</p>
