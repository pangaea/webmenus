<h1 class="help_title">Location Is Everything</h1>
<div class="help_block" style="margin: 20px;">

</div>
<p>
Everything starts with your location. It defines the location of your restaurant. All menus and orders are associated with a location.
<em>(Full support for franchises coming soon)</em>
</p><p>
You can navigate to your location(s) at any time by using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen.
From the Locations page (or the summary page) you can view, design and manage your menus.
Click "View Live Menus" to see what your location's menus will look like.
Click "View Menus Link" to see the link to your location's menus.
You can copy this link and place it anywhere on your web site or social media site.

<h1 class="help_title">Working With Menus</h1>
<div class="help_block" style="margin: 20px;">
<div>
  	<img class="fig" src="../w3/images/menu_designer.png"/><br/>
	<div>(Fig. 1)</div>
</div>
<p>
To create and edit menus for a location you can use the menu designer. Enter the designer by clicking the "Menu Designer" button.
Once the menu designer is loaded you can click "Learn how to use the Menu Designer" to view more detailed instructions on the use of this simple but powerful tool.

<h1 class="help_title">Viewing Your Menus</h1>
<div class="help_block" style="margin: 20px;">
<div>
	<img class="fig" src="../w3/images/location_menus.jpg"/><br/>
	<div>(Fig. 2)</div>
</div>
<p>
To view your location's menus, as a customer would, click the "View Live Menus" button.
You can completely control the look and feel of these menus using a theme.
A sample (but generic) theme is generated automatically for you and attached to your sample location.
You can create a brand new theme and select it for the location or simply make changes to the sample.
Using the theme, you can change colors, fonts, or the entire layout (if you really want to make it your own).

<h1 class="help_title">Taking Orders Online</h1>
<div class="help_block" style="margin: 20px;">
<div>
	<img class="fig" src="../w3/images/schedule_designer.png"/><br/>
	<div>(Fig. 4)</div>
</div>
<p>
To setup a menu to take orders you have two choices.
Either set "Take Orders" to true, manually, when the menu is open for orders or, select a schedule.
The advantage of using a schedule is to automatically open/close the menu based on the hours you want to take orders.
To create a schedule click on "Schedules" in the navigation bar.
</p><p>
Enter the Schedule Designer to set the open/close times based on weekday.
From this page you can schedule times when your location can receive orders which are emailed to a specified email address.
(more options available soon)

<h1 class="help_title">How Do You View Your Orders</h1>
<div class="help_block" style="margin: 20px;">
<div>

	<div>(Fig. 3)</div>
</div>
<p>
Clicking the tab "Orders" (or "View Orders" from the Summary page) will display all of the orders your location has received.
You can sort and/or search through your orders from here.
Orders are also emailed in real time to any email address
(using the 'Email Orders as PDFs' option you can receive orders by FAX using any popular FAXing service).
To view the link to your location's menus click the "View Menus Link" button.
This is the link to your location's live menus for use by patrons.
You can copy and paste this link onto any page of your web site or social media.

<img class="fig"/><br/>
<div style="text-align:right;"></div>
</div>
<p>
To view all the patrons who have submitted orders to your location click the "Patrons" link on the navigation bar.
As a results of your patrons creating online accounts you will have a database of emails and phone numbers that you can use to stay in touch.
