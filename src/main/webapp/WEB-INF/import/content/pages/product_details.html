  <span>What is chowMagic?</span>
  <p>
    <span>
      It's an online restaurant menu management system, running in the cloud, designed to make it easy to take orders over the Internet.
      chowMagic simplifies the process of creating and managing your menus yourself, without the need for any outside technical assistance.
      You can make changes on a day by day basis whenever you feel the need to do so.
      If you have access to an email account, you can take orders, just as easily.
      Create a schedule to define your hours of operation and let the orders come to you via email.
      If you'd prefer to receive orders via FAX, chowMagic is compatible with popular online FAXing services.

  <p>
    <span>

      Once you have created an account you can log in to the main chowMagic console and design your menu exactly how you want it.
      Publish your adjustments, place the link someplace on your site (or social media) and your ready to go.
